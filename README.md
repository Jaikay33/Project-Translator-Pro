🌍 A Handy Desktop Translator App
Ever wanted to translate text without having to open a new browser tab? This is a sleek and simple desktop app for all your translation needs!

Built with Python, it uses CustomTkinter to create a great-looking, modern interface that's easy on the eyes (dark mode included!). It connects to the Google Translate API through the deep-translator library, so you get fast, accurate translations.

What makes it cool:

1) It's Smart: Not sure what language you're typing in? Just leave the source as "auto (detect)," and it'll figure it out for you.

2) It Never Freezes: The best part! When you hit "Translate," the app does the work in the background. This means the window will never lock up or show "Not Responding," even if your internet is slow.

3) Super Simple: Just two boxes—one for your text, one for the translation. No clutter, no fuss.

4) To run this code print this command "Python 'file_name' .py".
